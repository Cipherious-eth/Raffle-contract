# Foundry smart contract lottery
 This is my first project working with chainlink VRFv2.5 and chainlink automation(keepers) using foundry

 The project is a simple lottery contract called raffle that allows people to enter the raffle and a verifiable random number will be generated using Chainlink Random Number Generator(RNG) from which a  random person is picked as winner

 The whole process is automated using chain automation or chainLink keepers
